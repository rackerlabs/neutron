    A new sync mode for OVN has been created which will allow an
    operator to "add" records to the OVN database without attempting
    to remove records. This is useful for operators who want to
    manage the OVN database manually, operate with a hybrid OVN
    environment, and/or only want to add records that are missing
    from a running cloud. This mode can be enabled by setting the
    command line switch ``--ovn-neutron_sync_mode`` to "add" or in
    the configuration file by setting ``ovn.neutron_sync_mode`` to
    "add".
